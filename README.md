# Hypercasual Mobile Game Project - EBAC Unity Course

This repository contains the source code for my Hypercasual mobile game project, developed as part of my portfolio for the Unity course at the British School of Creative Arts (EBAC).

## About the Game
The game is a Hypercasual title, designed to be simple yet addictive. It offers quick, easy-to-understand gameplay, making it perfect for on-the-go play on your mobile device.

## Technologies Used
The game was developed using Unity, a powerful 3D game development platform. The code was written in C#, with a focus on clean, efficient programming practices.

## Project Objective
This project serves as a demonstration of the skills I acquired during my Unity course at EBAC. It shows my understanding of game design principles, as well as my ability to implement these principles into a functional game.

I hope you enjoy playing as much as I enjoyed developing!
